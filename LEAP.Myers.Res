To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Madalina Dobra, and I am an accountant at Bader Martin. My husband’s name is Adrian Dobra and he is a Professor of statistics at the University of Washington. We have been friends of Monica Myers for many years. I am excited to have this opportunity to recommend her to your institution.
I have found Monica to be a highly intelligent, thoughtful and caring friend. She constantly demonstrates her commitment to friends, family and community. Monica is one of the most disciplined and punctual people I have ever known. Her ability to stay positive under stressful and nerve racking conditions is inspirational and speaks volumes about her character, determination and composed demeanor. Five years ago Monica had a baby that was born with a severe and unexpected birth defect. For several days she didn’t know if her child would survive. In those days of crisis, Monica demonstrated her deep reserve of courage, strength, and faith. I consider it an honor to count her among my friends.
Monica is a compassionate and hardworking human being with perseverance and ambition. I believe she is a deserving candidate and she would be a great and valuable addition to the your team. I strongly recommend Monica and I am available for any further details you wish to know about her.
Sincerely,
Madalina Dobra

To whom it may concern:
I am happy to provide this letter of recommendation for Monica Myers, a student at the Bothell campus of the University of Washington (UW-Bothell). I have known Monica since January of 2016, when she simultaneously started two winter-quarter courses with me: Principles of Anatomy & Physiology I (BBio 351) and an independent study on learning and expressing physiology via content-rich music (BBio 498). Since BBio 351 was a 40-student class and I got to know Monica best via BBio 498, my comments will focus primarily on BBio 498.
The idea of the independent study (BBio 498) sprang from a microbiology course Monica took in the fall of 2015 (BBio 370). One assignment for that course involved writing a poem about the material, and Monica found this assignment fun and helpful in consolidating her understanding. Her microbiology instructor, Dr. Kristina Hillesland, suggested that Monica further pursue this approach with me, since I have extensive experience in teaching science via music.
Monica’s independent study was officially a 2-credit course, meaning that she was expected to work on it for a minimum of 6 hours per week. Thanks to her interest in the biology and the chance to approach it creatively, she vastly exceeded this minimal time commitment, thus demonstrating her diligence and desire to surpass expectations. In working with Monica, the other thing I noticed right away was that she possessed good self-awareness of how she learns. For each potential song topic, she made a VERY extensive set of notes, which she then distilled down to a shorter set of notes, which she then used as a basis for creative brainstorming, in which she jotted down ideas for characters, rhymes, etc. She then generated many drafts, eventually polishing the most promising ones into final versions. To me, this seemed exhausting – and I think it was, in a way – but Monica seemed to know that this was how her brain would best take ownership of the content, and her final products validated her approach. Her three finished songs – “Circulatory System,” “Oxytocin,” and “Celia’s Ballad” – all showed a nuanced grasp of physiological concepts. In particular, “Celia’s Ballad” described insulin’s regulation of glucose uptake via a very clever and intricate metaphorical story, in which a total of nine key physiological players were represented as characters in the story. The effectiveness and appropriateness of the music was attested to by Monica’s BBio 351 classmates, who anonymously reviewed her songs and offered copious praise for their humor and melodies.
Although Monica’s independent study truly was an independent effort, with some modest oversight by me (one meeting per week), she demonstrated an ability to work effectively with others in BBio 351, the lecture/lab course. In particular, she wound up as the lab partner of another student who has severe neurological challenges, yet she and the other student were mutually supportive and, I think, benefited greatly from each other’s complementary strengths. For example, Monica would write out drafts of answers to worksheet questions before each lab so that her team would have more time for experiments and dissections, which they approached with more thoroughness than most of their classmates. Thus Monica has shown an ability to do good work both on her own and as a member of a diverse team.
